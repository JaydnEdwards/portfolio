## I’m involved in the community <span class="[ emoji ]" aria-hidden="true">🏡</span>

Until 2020, I was living in Pontefract, West Yorkshire where I was involved in my local community as a volunteer with Pontefract Castle and Pontefract Civic Society.

Pontefract is an amazing town with a rich, millennia long history.

### Pontefract Castle <span class="[ emoji ]" aria-hidden="true">🏰</span>
At the castle, I occasionally ran children’s activities, manned the dungeon, greeted guests and helped in the running of public events. I made some amazing connections in my time as a volunteer here.

### Pontefract Civic Society <span class="[ emoji ]" aria-hidden="true">🏘️</span>
As a volunteer with the Civic Society, I have been responsible for the execution of multiple design projects, including the new Blue Plaque Guide and the Pontefract Town Hall history guide. I’ve designed posters and images seen on their social media and have been consulted regarding web and SEO.

Despite my move to Lancaster, I still volunteer for the Civic Society when I have time.
