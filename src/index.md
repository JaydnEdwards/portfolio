## I'm looking for work!

I'm working on a six-month contract and am now looking for work. If you think I would fit in with your team, please [get in touch](mailto:jaydnedwards@outlook.com). Alternatively, you can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jaydn_Edwards) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaydnedwards/).

I’m a _designer who codes_, currently working as a Content Co-ordinator at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). I’m helping to build an all-new student search experience!

I have experience creating websites using _accessible & performant_ HTML/CSS (and SCSS!) and using _the JAMstack_ to create blogs made of static pages, as well as design for a range of mediums and contexts.

In my spare time, _I also make tarot cards_, over at [Inlustris Tarot](https://inlustristarot.com). I'm aiming to modernise tarot in a way that people can easily interpret and relate to the meanings of the cards. A modern deck for a digital age, if you like.
