I’m a _web developer_, currently working at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). I work on creating Content Types for TerminalFour CMS.

I have experience creating websites using _accessible & performant_ HTML/CSS (and SCSS!) and using _the JAMstack_ to create blogs made of static pages, as well as design for a range of mediums and contexts.

In my spare time, _I also make tarot cards_, over at [Inlustris Tarot](https://inlustristarot.com). I'm aiming to modernise tarot in a way that people can easily interpret and relate to the meanings of the cards. A modern deck for a digital age, if you like.
