I’m a <span class="highlight">designer who codes</span>, currently working as a <span class="highlight">Digital Skills Graduate Intern</span> at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). I’m helping to build digital confidence across campus and develop digital skills across the University. This includes the delivery of live training sessions to both staff and students, creation of learning digital materials, content auditing & reviewing, as well as using a CMS to create engaging webpages.

I have experience creating websites using <span class="highlight">accessible & performant HTML/CSS</span> (and SCSS!), as well as <span class="highlight">design for a range of mediums and contexts</span>. I volunteer for the [Pontefract Civic Society](https://www.pontefractcivicsociety.org.uk/), where I design marketing materials and the bi-monthly newsletter, [Pontefract Voice](https://www.pontefractcivicsociety.org.uk/latest-news/pontefractvoice/), that reaches over 400 people.

In my spare time, <span class="highlight">I also make tarot cards</span>, over at [Inlustris Tarot](https://inlustristarot.com). I'm aiming to modernise tarot in a way that people can easily interpret and relate to the meanings of the cards.
