It finally happened!

Since January 2020, I'd been working on temporary contracts just so that I _had_ a job. They weren't really what I wanted to do (except for my four month secondment to the web team), but paid decently and gave me more time to get a permanent role.

In February, a permanent web role came up and I interviewed a few weeks later. I got the job that day!

I've been in this role almost a month now, working on the [Lancaster University website](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk). The major parts of my role are building content types, maintaining the website, helping with refreshes and working with other departments, such as Marketing.

I'm so happy to have some stability after two years of temporary contracts and three years since I left university!
