excerpt: I picked up bookbinding as a new hobby, and it's really stuck! I want to talk more about it and show some of my work.

Recently, I decided to try a new hobby where I'm not staring at yet another screen. I ended up trying my hand at bookbinding, and so far it's stuck!

The reason I chose bookbinding was kinda impulsive. I've been watching [videos about commonplace books](https://youtu.be/QoA7qF_xTwM): a method of writing in an indexed book to store and retrieve information. Kind of like a life wiki! This really seemed to resonate with me, so I decided to buy a new notebook to try it out.

I knew it had to be nice for me to want to write in it, so I ended up buying a 400 page A4 hardback lined notebook from [NoteworthyGiftShop on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1223668863/thick-a4-blue-and-gold-marble-notebook?ref=yr_purchases). The pages are 100gsm, so nice and thick! This got me thinking...

Could I make one?

The answer is yes, absolutely!

I started watching bookbinding videos and the process seemed simple enough; all you're relly doing is folding and sewing pages together, assembling a cover and glueing it all together. I adore books so the inspiration and watching the process was enough for me to dive right in.

So far, I've really enjoyed what I've been doing. Counting and folding pages for signatures (groups of pages), and then sewing those signatures has been really relaxing, especially with some chilled music in the background. Once you get into the flow of things, your mind starts to calm and wander. I'd definitely reommend it to reduce stress. Watch your fingers though; I've pricked myself a _lot_.

I do make mistakes and it doesn't always go how I planned, but that's okay! I'm still enjoying the process.
